/*
SETUP:
1. initialize
create population of N elements
*/

/*
DRAW
2. SELECTION: Evaluate the fitness of each element of the population and build a mating tool
2.1 FITNESS FUNCTION:
2.2 MATING TOOL FUNCTION
 */

/*
3. REPRODUCTION: Repeat N times
3.1 pick parents according to relative fitness
3.2 Crossover - create a "child" by combining the DNA of the parents
3.3 Mutation -  mutate the child's DNA based on a given probability.
3.4 add the new child to a new population
 */
/*
4. Replace old population with new Population and return to step 2
