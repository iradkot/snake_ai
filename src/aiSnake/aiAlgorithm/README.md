##### PLAN:
1. **initialize:**
create population of N elements
<br/> not a problem just create multiple dna's in a population group

**2. SELECTION**: Evaluate the fitness of each element of the population and build a mating tool
2.1 FITNESS FUNCTION:
<br /> not an issue - highest snake score (largest snake Array** maybe also smallest speed between gathering these array will help) 
<br />2.2 MATING TOOL FUNCTION

<br />For this we need to know how is our dna gona look like.
It is gonna be an array of commands(left/right..)/numbers(which symbolise commands?)/objects of something?
according to this dna setup it will know how to behave in the snake map. it will get what we see:
snake length and position, food position, borders(not must) and score - maybe its also god if it will get better as it goes and will be updated once it gathers food?
